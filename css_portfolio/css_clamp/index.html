A monster from the Upside Down escapes and abducts a boy named Will Byers and teenage girl called Barbara. Will's mother, Joyce, and the town's police chief, Jim Hopper, search for Will. At the same time, a young psychokinetic girl called Eleven escapes from the laboratory and assists Will's friends, Mike, Dustin, and Lucas, in their own efforts to find Will.</p>
